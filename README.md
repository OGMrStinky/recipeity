# Recipeity

This project is a simple recipe manager and display tool.

I find a lot of recipes on food blogs using Pinterest, FoodGawker, etc.  Pinterest is great for finding/storing/organizing links to sites using cards.  Food blogs typically have LOTS of banners, ads, popups, and autoplay videos that are constantly changing the page layout.  After I find a recipe, I want a clean site to store the recipe so that I don't lose it if the blog shuts down or changes.  I also cook from my laptop and want a view that allows me to show the ingredient list on half the screen and recipe steps on the other so that I can scroll them independently while cooking.

I started from: https://github.com/attilaantal/PHP-OOP-Login-Register-System which is a code dump from YouTube Playlist - OOP Login/Register System by Alex @Codecourse.  The Codecourse videos are great at introducing and walking through how to build web apps in PHP.  I'm a dangerous novice PHP developer and worse with Javascript.  I'd love to be able to pull my master ingredient list from OurGroceries.com (https://www.ourgroceries.com/overview) and push items onto my lists because I love their app for use at the grocery.

Tentative Roadmap:
